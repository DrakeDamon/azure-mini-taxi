## Problem
Show end‑to‑end Azure orchestration with monitoring and CI/CD in a day.

## Approach
ADF Copy lands a public taxi CSV into ADLS Gen2 (`taxi/raw`). A Databricks Notebook writes Delta Bronze → Silver and a Gold daily fact table. We added a daily trigger, an alert rule on failed pipeline runs, and a GitHub Action that imports `/Shared/bronze_silver` on push. Secrets use Databricks Secret Scopes for OAuth to ADLS.

## Screenshots
Embed images from `../images/` (linked services, pipeline canvas, failed & succeeded runs, raw file, DBX counts, GH Actions, alert rule/email, dbt query).

## Impact
Demonstrates ADF orchestration, secure storage access (OAuth), Delta medallion modeling, CI/CD, and operational readiness (scheduling/alerts). Suitable for production extension (Unity Catalog, job clusters, Purview).
